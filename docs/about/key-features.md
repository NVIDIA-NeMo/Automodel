### Day-0 Hugging Face Integration

Automodel provides immediate support for newly released and existing models on the Hugging Face Hub without requiring conversions or checkpoint rewrites, saving significant development time. 

**Key Benefits:**
- **Immediate Model Access**: Use new models as soon as they're released on HF Hub
- **No Conversion Required**: Direct model loading without format changes
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless compatibility with `datasets`, tokenizers, and HF tooling
- **Preserved APIs**: Maintain familiar Hugging Face interfaces and workflows

The rapid pace of open-source model releasesâ€”including Meta Llama, Google Gemma, Mistral Codestral, Codestral Mamba, Large 2, Mixtral, Qwen 3, 2, and 2.5, Deepseek R1, NVIDIA Nemotron, and NVIDIA Llama Nemotronâ€”creates opportunities for immediate experimentation. AutoModel eliminates the traditional delay between model release and optimized training recipes, enabling teams to leverage cutting-edge models for competitive advantage.

## Backend Comparison: Megatron-Core vs AutoModel

The NVIDIA NeMo Framework leverages Megatron-Core and Transformer-Engine backends to achieve high throughput and Model Flops Utilization (MFU) across NVIDIA GPU clusters. AutoModel provides a high-level interface over this infrastructure, enabling immediate Hugging Face compatibility while accessing the framework's proven optimizations. Understanding when to use AutoModel versus direct Megatron-Core helps you choose the right approach for your training needs. 

In short: **Megatron-Core offers peak throughput and full 4D parallelism; AutoModel offers Dayâ€‘0 breadth with strong performance and simpler setup.**

### Framework Comparison Overview

NeMo Framework offers two complementary training backends, each optimized for different use cases:
