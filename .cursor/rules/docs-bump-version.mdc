1. Update the [versions1.json](mdc:docs/versions1.json) file with the user's provided version by adding a new entry at the top and updating preferred to false for the previous entry.
2. Update the [project.json](mdc:docs/project.json) file with the new version number.
3. Update the version components in [nemo_automodel/package_info.py](mdc:nemo_automodel/package_info.py) by modifying the MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH, and PRE_RELEASE variables as needed.
4. Create a tag for the latest commit on the `main` branch in the format of "git tag docs-v{}.{}.{}`.
5. Push the tag.
6. Recap everything you did to prepare for the release.

If a user asks you to bump the version but hasn't provided a full version number, ask for clarification on the version number.
